# Warning

This approach is only a framework from reﬂexión to analyze how carefully or late we can adapt the general measures to our individual risk. 

The risk factors are drawn from the studies to date with COVID-19 and the known physiopathology risk factors for severe viral infections, and in particular for SARS-CoV-2. 

These thoughts do not replace medical advice, if you have a pathology of special risk, sure that your doctor can clarify the doubts to you better. 

You may think that these are excessively prudent recommendations, but in my experience they are not: the recommendation to go 1-2 weeks behind is not so aggressive and with all that remains to be known, if I am to sin, it will be prudent. 

And it will be for your own good.
